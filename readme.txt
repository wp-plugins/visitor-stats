Visitor Stats keeps track of information about every visitor (page load).

== Description ==

visitor-stats records information about every visitor (page load). Requested URL, Referring URL, IP address, Hostname and Browser along with Date/Time are recorded and displayed in a tabular fashion. Geographical resolution of IP address (it's only approximate) is also included.

== Installation ==

1. Unzip visitor-stats.zip
2. This should result in a folder called visitor-stats
3. Upload visitor-stats to /wp-content/plugins/ folder in your blog
4. Activate it
5. If all goes well, plugin should start recording the hits/page-loads
6. See the visitor details in Dashboard-->Visitor Details

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't like the way visitor details are displayed. Can I change it to meet my fantasies? =

Yes. If you know basic HTML and some PHP, you should be able to change it.

= What does the IP address link to in visitor details? =

It links to the ARIN WHOIS database and provides some more information that you may (not) find useful.

= It only says #### hits so far and following are recorded today. What if I want to check my visitors from some other day? =

Very valid question. Like #3, this feature will be added in a subsequent update. 

= I don't want to record my own visits. Is there something you can do about it? =

Another valid question. This feature will be included in a subsequent update.

= I want to know who (a given IP address) is stalking me =

Good idea (thanks to Kyle Schneider and Amy Krause)! This will also be included in a later update.

= My blog has many users and I want to know which user is accessing which page. =

Another good idea (thanks to Richard Tape). This is also being worked on and will be included in a later update.

= 17MB for a plugin (and 28MB when unzipped)? Are you out of your mind?? =

Over 95% of it is accounted by the data that maps an IP address to geographical location.

= If everything you promised earlier is not gonna be in this update, why should I even bother upgrading on my server? =

Excellent question - in its earlier versions, this plugin was causing some unforeseen errors effectively disabling the login screen and adding lot more complexity to your already complex life. This update fixes that issue. No more such errors - thanks to Amy Krause for testing it out!

== Screenshots ==

1. Once the plugin is installed, activated and some hits/page-loads have been recorded, visitor details look like this.
